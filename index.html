		Mostly good
		</p>
		<p class="main">
		Eat as much as you can, quality stuff, mostly. Then, reflect upon your health, and that you should eat less and move around more. Finally, collapse.

	<section class="col-desktop col-tablet-upper col-mobile">
		<p class="header" id="header2">
		Average
		</p>
		<p class="main">Just do with the average stuff, whatever that may mean, or bring. Boring, repetitive, too little salad, too few oranges. But well, this is better than the suffering of eating bad bad bad food.</p>

		<p class="header" id="header3">
		Horrible
		</p>
		<p class="main">Or 'Orrible', as a Frenchman might say. Little you can do, other than lorep ipsum yourself until you've had it. This is nonsense. It always has been.</p>
